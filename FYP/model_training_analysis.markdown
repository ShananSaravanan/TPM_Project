## Model Training Analysis

### How the Model is Trained
The training process for your RUL prediction model follows a structured pipeline using XGBoost. It begins with loading data from a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, pulling tables like `PdM_telemetry.csv`, `PdM_machines.csv`, `PdM_maint.csv`, `PdM_errors.csv`, and `PdM_failures.csv`. The data is preprocessed by converting datetime columns, merging dataframes based on `machineID`, and handling missing values. Feature engineering then creates relevant inputs, such as time since last maintenance, error frequency, and rolling statistics like means and standard deviations of sensor data (e.g., `volt`, `rotate`, `pressure`, `vibration`).

The XGBoost model is trained with a manual TQDM loop for progress tracking, incorporating hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, max depth) and cross-validation to optimize performance. The training data, split into features (X) and target (y, the RUL), is normalized or transformed (e.g., square root) to address extreme values. The model evaluates performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R², with the best parameters saved. The final model is persisted, possibly with feature importance plots generated for analysis.

### Which Parts are the SPC Parts
SPC techniques are integrated to enhance data quality and detect outliers, crucial given the challenges with extreme RUL values. These parts involve calculating control limits (e.g., mean ± 3 standard deviations) for sensor metrics like `volt`, `rotate`, `pressure`, or `vibration` over time. This process flags data points exceeding these limits as outliers, which are either removed or weighted differently during training. The SPC implementation is embedded in the preprocessing stage, analyzing temporal data to identify anomalies, possibly using rolling statistics (e.g., 6 or 12-hour windows) to establish baseline trends. These flagged outliers (e.g., the 8,334 records with errors > 2×RMSE) refine the dataset before model training.

### Did It Find Significance of Other Features? If Yes, Where?
Yes, feature significance is assessed to prioritize impactful variables using XGBoost’s built-in feature importance scoring, calculating the gain (contribution to reducing loss) for each feature. In your results, this is evident from top features like `machine model` (e.g., 40106.96 for model1), `machine age` (26708.33), `recent error count` (18990.19), and others like `error count` and `time since last error`. The code for this resides in the post-training phase, where `xgboost.plot_importance()` is called after training to generate the feature importance plot, ranking features based on their impact for subsequent iterations.

### Adding Derived Features
This section introduces new features engineered from existing data to capture meaningful patterns:

- `data['sensor_degradation'] = data[sensor_features].mean(axis=1)`: Computes the average value across all sensor features (e.g., `volt`, `rotate`, `pressure`, `vibration`) for each row, aggregating sensor health into a single degradation indicator, assuming lower or higher averages might signal wear.
- `data['error_rate'] = data['error_count'] / (data['time_since_last_error'].replace(0, 1))`: Calculates the rate of errors by dividing the number of errors by the time since the last error, with a safeguard to avoid division by zero (replacing 0 with 1), reflecting error frequency relative to time, a key predictor of machine health.
- `data['volt_change'] = data.groupby('machineid')['volt'].diff().fillna(0)`: Computes the difference in `volt` values between consecutive rows for each `machineID`, filling initial `NaN` values with 0. Similar operations are applied to `rotate_change`, `pressure_change`, and `vibration_change`, creating change metrics to detect sudden shifts in sensor readings.
- `data['volt_error_inter'] = data['volt_change'] * data['error_rate']`: Multiplies `volt_change` by `error_rate` to create an interaction term, capturing how voltage changes correlate with error frequency. The same is done for `rotate_error_inter`, linking sensor dynamics with error patterns.
- `data['sensor_volatility'] = data[sensor_features].std(axis=1)`: Calculates the standard deviation across sensor features for each row, serving as a volatility measure to indicate inconsistency in sensor readings, which could signal instability.
- `data['recent_error_count'] = data.groupby('machineid')['time_since_last_error'].transform(lambda x: (x < 24).sum())`: Counts errors within the last 24 hours for each `machineID` by applying a lambda function that sums instances where time since the last error is less than 24 hours, highlighting recent fault activity.

### Adding Rolling Features with Multiple Windows
This section generates rolling statistics to capture temporal trends:

- `for feature in sensor_features:`: Iterates over each sensor feature (e.g., `volt`, `rotate`, etc.).
- **Very Short-Term Window (6 hours):**
  - `data[f'{feature}_rolling_mean_6']`: Computes the 6-hour rolling mean for each sensor feature per `machineID`, smoothed using `groupby('machineID')` and `rolling(window=6)`, tracking short-term trends.
  - `data[f'{feature}_rolling_std_6']`: Calculates the 6-hour rolling standard deviation, indicating short-term variability.
- **Short-Term Window (12 hours):** Similar to the 6-hour window but over 12 hours, capturing slightly longer trends with `rolling_mean_12` and `rolling_std_12`.
- **Medium-Term Window (24 hours):** Extends to 24 hours with `rolling_mean_24` and `rolling_std_24`, providing a broader view of sensor behavior.
- `.reset_index(level=0, drop=True)`: Resets the index after rolling calculations to align with the original dataframe structure, ensuring consistency.

### For the RUL (Remaining Useful Life)
The transformation applied to `RUL` in your `train_model_postgre.py` script is a square root transform. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- **Initial Calculation**: The `RUL` is calculated as the time difference between the `last_failure` datetime and the current `datetime` for each record, converted to hours: `data['RUL'] = (data['last_failure'] - data['datetime']).dt.total_seconds() / 3600`. This raw RUL is then filtered to exclude values greater than 4000 hours or less than 0 (`data = data[data['RUL'] <= 4000]` and `data = data[data['RUL'] >= 0]`).
- **Transformation**: After filtering, a square root transform is applied to the `RUL`: `data['RUL'] = np.sqrt(data['RUL'])`. This transformation addresses extreme values and stabilizes the distribution, making it suitable for modeling. The square root reduces the impact of large RUL values, consistent with results showing mean predicted and actual RUL on the sqrt scale (e.g., 26.21 and 25.86, respectively).
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained and evaluated using this sqrt-transformed `RUL` as the target variable (y). Performance metrics (RMSE and R²) are reported on both the sqrt scale (comparing `y_pred` with `y_test`) and the original scale (reversing with `y_pred_orig = y_pred ** 2` and `y_test_orig = y_test ** 2`), providing metrics like RMSE = 246.41 hours and R² = 0.90.
